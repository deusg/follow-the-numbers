# Follow the Numbers
This simple game allows you to connect dots by clicking on them in sequence. The dots are randomly placed on the screen, and you can connect them by clicking on each dot in order.

# How to Play
Dots will appear on the screen.
Click on each dot in numerical order to connect them with lines.
If you click on a dot out of sequence, the lines will reset.
